## About

This game was made in 48 hours for the Signal Mini Jam 2023. The theme was "Signal" and the game had to be made in 48 hours. The game was made in Unity and the art was made in Aseprite.

It is unfinished but I hope you enjoy it. I plan to continue this project with the help of my friends.

## How to play

Move around using the arrow keys and jump with space. Platforms will spawn on the beat of the loop on the location of the mouse. So you have to time your jumps to the beat of the loop.
